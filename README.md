# genetic_algorithm_evolution_guided_by_LLM

## Project Overview

This project explores how to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Genetic Algorithms (GA) by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo. Traditionally, GAs rely on random generation of the initial population and random mutations during the evolution process. By integrating the pre-trained knowledge and reasoning capabilities of an LLM, we aim to guide the generation of the initial population and the direction of mutations, leading to better optimization results in less time.
